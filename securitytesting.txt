Hereâ€™s a list of tools you can integrate into your CI/CD pipeline for security testing in a Node.js project:

1. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools
These tools analyze your codebase for vulnerabilities without executing it:

ESLint Security Plugin: Detects security issues in JavaScript/Node.js code.
SonarQube: Provides static code analysis with security rules for JavaScript/Node.js.
Semgrep: Lightweight, customizable static analysis for security vulnerabilities.


2. Dependency Scanning Tools
These tools check for vulnerabilities in your project dependencies:

Snyk: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies and suggests fixes.
npm audit: Built into npm, it identifies vulnerabilities in your package.json.
OWASP Dependency-Check: Detects vulnerable dependencies in your project.


3. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) Tools
These tools test your running application for vulnerabilities:

OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy): Scans your application for runtime vulnerabilities.
Burp Suite: A powerful tool for dynamic security testing of web applications.


4. Container Security Tools
If your Node.js app is containerized:

Trivy: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities.
Aqua Security: Provides container security scanning and runtime protection.


5. CI/CD Integration Tools
These tools help integrate security testing into your CI/CD pipeline:

GitHub Actions: Use pre-built actions for tools like Snyk, ESLint, or npm audit.
Jenkins Plugins: Plugins like OWASP Dependency-Check or SonarQube for Jenkins.
GitLab CI/CD: Built-in security scanning features for dependencies and code.


Best Practices for Integration

Automate security testing at every stage of the pipeline (e.g., during code commit, build, and deployment).
Use a combination of SAST, DAST, and dependency scanning for comprehensive coverage.
Regularly update your tools to ensure they detect the latest vulnerabilities.

These tools and practices will help secure your Node.js project effectively!
